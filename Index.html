      <p>[Notice: If you are fortunate enough to read this letter, we advise you to keep it to yourself. This program is for the ones we have selected for the [REDACTED] commands. We’d like to inform you that others will be in this program with you as well, but do not share this information with anyone – at all. If we catch you or hear murmurs of this program from tongues we did not inform; you will face the consequences of this action.] </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
	Amanda Foley, we would like to congratulate you on being selected for this program. We will ensure that your safety and health is beyond anyone's desires. As you may already know, the world has been flooded by the hellish cries of fear, agony, and desperation. Darkness has spread itself throughout the globe and is something far from our own knowledge – far from our own comprehension. These things have entered and infiltrated various coastlines and cities, both in this country and those outside of it; and several accounts inform that many surface from the fog. It is our duty to protect the citizens from unavoidable casualties, and an unavoidable end. For this very reason, we have created the Search, Transport, Aid, and Rescue (S.T.A.R.) Program. Once again, our duty, your duty, is to help citizens in this country from the inevitable danger these things have against us. However, do not be cowardly at the scenes you may see when on duty, it will only lead to a failed mission; and that, They cannot afford to happen. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
	For your duties and expeditions, you will be given plenty of supplies, food, and water to last you months (weapons and armor are included). Use these supplies to help you look for any survivors you might encounter on your way to an assigned area. Please note that you need to be mindful of your supplies, though they can last for months, they are still prone to being stolen, destroyed, or sold. You will be assigned a team, and with that team you all will be assigned a specific location. If you fail to keep your flock (those who you, and your team, successfully rescued), keep your supplies safe and out of danger; you and your team will be faced with the same consequence. The citizens’ safety is our number one priority, and we can't let this country crumble to the hands of those monsters, let alone be replaced from the top of the food chain. We advise and trust you to keep those who you rescue, yourself included, from inescapable danger. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
	If you have developed any questions while reading this letter, we encourage you to keep those questions to yourself. Whatever you’re curious about, we are not allowed to answer it for you, let alone those who are higher than us, but lower than Them. However, we are allowed to assure all of you, who are chosen to participate in this program, are to be kept safe. Alas, if questions start to fill the air, and if rumors start to be passed from tongue to tongue; we will take immediate action and make you, and those who have taken a part of that intolerable action, will endure a consequence to ensure that it won’t happen again. </p>

	[Further Notice: If you are reading this text, I can only assume you looked far enough to find it. What I have been telling you about the S.T.A.R. Program was all a cover up from the reality of it. Only a selected few have been provided with this additional text. The sole reason that they have provided you (and the many others) with this information, is because you are trustworthy, loyal, and valuable to Them. Now if you may, please go ahead and read the following information below.] </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
	The S.T.A.R. Program is a very strict program that They have provided us with. There was never an intended reason to rescue the people, but to simply keep them alive. The people are valuable in many ways — ways that can change humanity as a whole. We will fill the people with false hope with this program, and we will have further control over them. This program is a part of an operation set by the [REDACTED] to accomplish something that failed many years ago. The true meaning of the program is: The Seclude, Transgress, Affiliate, and Rebirth Operation; Better known as, S.T.A.R. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Your main mission is the following: </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Search for any citizens and bring them towards the safety bases established around the country. If it costs the lives of those around you, so be it. We, most especially you, cannot be hesitant about the work/directions that were given to us. If so, we cannot promise second chances. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Transport the surviving citizens in the vehicles that’ll be provided for you. They have a capacity of up to 16 people. Bring as many as you can back to the bases, and remember to keep them in great conditions. The conditions of the vehicles aren’t as important as getting the people safe. If you still have doubts, the vehicles are made of pure steel. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Aid those who are injured or on the verge of death. We cannot afford to lose the lives of our citizens to the claws of those creatures. Additionally, if you fail, or run out of supplies to continue aiding the people, hurry them back to one of the bases. From there, they’ll be taken care of and aided back to health before they end up dying. This will ensure both you and the person get to live to see another day. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Rescue the citizens no matter what means necessary. They are very important to Them, and They will not let one be killed by your foolishness. Protect the citizens inside of those bases, assure that nothing or no one gets in or out, and reassure the people that they are in safe hands; they do not have the right to leave. They will be reborn into something beautiful, something that’ll bring hope to our nation, and put us at the top of the food chain once again. We cannot and will not fail the [REDACTED]. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Be careful with the decisions you make, because they’ll either lead to death, or something far worse. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            We appreciate you for taking this time to read this letter provided to you. It’s an honor to have you part of this program and help the people flee from those things. [REDACTED] is looking forward to working with you, and They hope you are willing to work for them as well. Further information that was not mentioned, explained, or elaborated on will be announced in the conference in [REDACTED]. Don’t be late. </p>
